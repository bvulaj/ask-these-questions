* How are disagreements solved - both technical disagreements and other kinds? What happens when personalities clash?

## Quality of life
* How much vacation do people get? If there’s “unlimited” vacation, how much vacation do people normally take?
* Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?
* What’s your process for making sure you have diversity in your workforce?
* How many hours do people work in an average week? In your busiest weeks?
* Is variability tolerated or is everyone expected to be on the same schedule?
* What time do people normally get to work? What time do people normally leave work?
* Would I need to be on call? How often?
* How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?
* What is your turnover rate like? How many devs were hired last year and how many left? Do you think you could’ve done anything differently to keep people who left?

* Do people check in when they’re on vacation? How often?
* Is it possible to work from home, say, 1 or 2 days a week? Does anyone do this?
