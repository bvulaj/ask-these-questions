# Questions for an interviewer from an interviewee
A categorized list of questions that you may want to know the answers to before accepting a job offer in the software field.

## Engineering practices
* What version control system do you use? (if none, the interview should be over =))
* Do you test your code?
* How do you make sure that all code is understood by more than one person?
* Do you do code review? Does all code get reviewed?
* Do you have an issue tracker?
* Describe your deployment process – how do you find bugs in your team’s code? What recourse do you have when you find a serious bug in production code?
* Who is responsible for doing deployment? How often do you deploy?
* How do you think about code correctness?
* When something goes wrong, how do you handle it? Do devs get shamed for breaking the build?
* How/when do developers talk to non-developers? Is it easy to talk to the people who are will be using your product?
* Can I see some code the team I’m interviewing for has written? (from an open-source project you work on, for example)
* Who are the people at your company with a lot of depth of experience? Will I be able to talk to them?
* What’s your approach to technical debt?

## Management style
* How does engineering work get assigned?
* How are technical decisions made and communicated?
* How do you balance support work and feature development?
* Can you give me an example of someone who’s been in a technical role at your company for a long time, and how their responsibilities and role have changed? (I love this question)
* Do you have a dedicated designer? QA? Technical writer? Dev manager?
* How often do you have meetings? Are there any scheduled/standing meetings? Who talks to customers (if appropriate) and how?
* Has there been a situation where someone raised an ethical concern? If so, how was it handled? If not, have there really not been any?
* How are decisions made? Is architecture dictated top down? Are ideas from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?
* How are disagreements solved - both technical disagreements and other kinds? What happens when personalities clash?
* Can you tell me about a time when you’ve had to let someone go?
* Is there a written roadmap all developers can see? How far into the future does it extend? How closely is it followed?
* How is performance evaluated?

## Quality of life
* How much vacation do people get? If there’s “unlimited” vacation, how much vacation do people normally take?
* Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?
* How many women work for you? What’s your process for making sure you have diversity in other ways?
* How many hours do people work in an average week? In your busiest weeks?
* Is variability tolerated or is everyone expected to be on the same schedule?
* What time do people normally leave work?
* Would I need to be on call? How often?
* How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?
* What is your turnover rate like? How many devs were hired last year and how many left?
* What’s your retention rate of women over 1.5 years? Do you think you could’ve done anything differently to keep people who left?
* Do people work on the weekend?
* Do people check in when they’re on vacation? How often?
* Is it possible to work from home, say, 1 or 2 days a week? Does anyone do this? (can be a nice option to have)
* Does this position require travel? How often?

As many of these as possible are “statistical” questions – a company may say that they “don’t have hours”, but if everyone leaves at 9pm that’s not a good sign.

## Community involvement
* Do you contribute to open source projects? Which projects? Which teams work on open source? Do you work mostly in the community or do you have a private fork?
* Do your employees speak at conferences about your work?

## Career development
* Are employees encouraged to go speak at conferences?
* Do you cover travel to conferences? How many conferences a year do devs typically go to?
* Does your company support continuing education? (will they pay for employees to do a master’s degree?)
* In what other ways do you support career development?

## Culture
* How do you determine if someone is a poor fit for your company?
* How are your teams structured? What is the management structure like?
* How often do you pair? What’s pairing like? How often do inexperienced people work directly with experienced people?
* What’s the onboarding process like?
* Is there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with plateauing or preventing burnout? (Expecting to hear about rotation of duties or location, sabbaticals.)
* Is it easy to move to other divisions or offices?
* How does internal communication work? This one is super important and I need to remember to ask it more.
* Are there catered suppers? (possibly bad)
* How many hours a week does senior management work? Do they put in 80-hour weeks?

## Financials, business model and growth
* Are you profitable?
* if not, how does this affect what you can do? What’s your planned timeline for becoming profitable?
* How do you make money? (I often explain to my parents or non-technical friends companies’ business models to test if they really make sense.)
* How much are you planning to hire in the next year?
* Are company financials, minus salaries, transparent throughout the company?

## Things to look for IRL
* How is the office space physically organized?

## Other
* Can you tell me about how the interview process is structured? How many interviews are there?
* How often do you offer above asking? Can I speak with someone who got such an offer?
* What do you wish you had known when you joined this company?
* Why did you choose to join this company?
* What’s the single biggest issue or problem facing the team/department/company?” What’s currently being done to address it?
